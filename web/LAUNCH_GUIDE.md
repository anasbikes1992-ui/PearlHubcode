## What still needs doing before public launch ⚠️

### Critical (must have before taking real money)
1. **Real payment gateway** — PayHere or Stripe integration via Supabase Edge Function
2. **CBSL compliance** — if wallet holds real LKR, need Payment Service Provider license
3. **SLTDA registration** — Tourism Act compliance for listing platform
4. **Privacy Policy & Terms** — drafted by a Sri Lankan lawyer
5. **WhatsApp Business API** — Dialog or Hutch BSP account for booking notifications

### Important (launch month)
6. **iCal Edge Function** — `supabase/functions/ical-export/` to serve provider calendar feeds
7. **Damage deposit Edge Function** — auto-release cron job
8. **Pearl Points award cron** — runs `auto_release_deposits()` daily
9. **Email templates** — booking confirmation, payment receipt, review request (Supabase SMTP)
10. **Admin first user** — manually set first admin via Supabase SQL editor

### Nice to have (month 2)
11. **Stripe Connect** — provider payout automation
12. **Google Analytics 4** — conversion tracking
13. **Hotjar** — user session recording
14. **Sentry** — error monitoring
